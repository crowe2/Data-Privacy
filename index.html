<p id="para2">What information have you put out on the internet? How much of that data do you think actually stayed confidential? What websites or applications have you inputted personal information into? Do you feel like you are being tracked/monitored while browsing the internet?  </p>
	<h2>My Opinion on Data Privacy</h2>
<p>As technology continues to advance, we will start seeing more and more software and application that will be collecting data to make our lives easier and convient. However, would you like large billion dollar companies and corporations having access to all of your personal data? This is a question that many people are having to ask themselves. Convenience over Privacy, being able to look up the closest restaurant, gas station, store, movies, etc or not give access for your smart device to use your current location. Easy checkout by allowing your smart phone to save your billing, shpping, and credit card information.

Here is a exert from Mary Meehan article titled "Data Privacy Will Be The Most Important Issue In The Decade" that explains how devices that have features such as siri, alexa, and other voice activated devices are listening to everything.
	<blockquote>We now know that voice-activated devices are listening all the time. Are our phones eavesdropping on  us, too, as reported on Marketplace last May? Itâ€™s inconclusive, but the investigation suggests there may be more ways we give away information than we realize. We also need to mention all the Ring and Nest doorbell systems capturing video not just from your front door but all around the neighborhood, as well. Ring is actively collaborating with local law enforcement - a practice that is raising privacy questions at the local level.</blockquote>

<p id="para3">Personally, I know I have noticed certain "coincidences" when using social media and my search engine. I could be looking up a sweatshirt that I like or simply online shopping and then notice that same brand or item that I was looking at on my safari is now on my instagram timeline as an ad. How do you think that can come about? How are Instagram and Snapchat able to utilize my browsing history and put it on my feed/timeline? Even with local restaurants, my current location is known to social media and they use that to suggest or advertise. </p>
